TEMPORARY SOLUTION FOR ICONS:

You can use ANY PNG images as placeholders. Just rename them to:
- icon16.png (any small image, Chrome will resize)
- icon48.png (any small image, Chrome will resize)
- icon128.png (any small image, Chrome will resize)

Quick options:

1. Screenshot any emoji or icon from your screen and save as PNG
2. Download from: https://www.iconfinder.com/search?q=play&price=free
3. Use the create_icons.html file in this folder (open in browser, it will download the icons)
4. Or just continue without icons - the extension will work, just won't show an icon

The extension will work perfectly fine without custom icons - Chrome will just show a default placeholder.
